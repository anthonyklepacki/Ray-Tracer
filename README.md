# Ray-Tracer
Sandbox to create ray tracer in C++

The basic renderer is heavily based on the work of Peter Shirley and http://in1weekend.blogspot.com/2016/01/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend.html. This will be used to explore more complex ray tracing methods for efficiency such as tree-based mapping, etc.
